Currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science at Rowan University, I have independently developed projects like VoiceCheck AI, SmokeScanAI, and MedLens — tackling audio forensics, radiology, and X-ray diagnostics. My focus is on deep learning, NLP, and computer vision with a passion for explainability and medical AI. Skilled in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, React, and end-to-end ML deployment, I treat every personal project like a production system — testing, iterating, and building with real-world use in mind.",
